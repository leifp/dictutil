========

Useful functions for working with dicts.

An attempt to collect best-of-breed functions from the associative array 
libraries of many programming languages.  Lots of them are one-liners in
python, but giving them names and collecting them all in one place will
make for more readable code.

The code is fairly well-tested (100% coverage, at least).  However, I 
consider this alpha code, because the functions and their behavior may
change at any time depending on feedback I get about what is useful or 
more pythonic.
